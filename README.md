# JavaOOPproject

A food ordering system simulator where 
you can order food from a variety of choices and check them later on your inventory. 
This application has other features like a search bar and a cart and allows the user to create a new 
account that will be saved in the database.

For the GUI, NetBeans Apache IDE 23 offers a form editing tool where the user can drag 
and drop GUI components without the need to write the code for the GUI. The backend is 
then done manually. The background and icons of the application are then later modified in 
VS Code to improve the design. 
For the database, the SQLite dependency is added to the pom.xml file of the project first 
before adding the codes for interacting with the database. The database is made using the 
DB Browser (SQLite) by creating a database file (.db file) and by moving it to the directory 
of the project. 
Eclipse IDE is then used to export the runnable JAR file, and Launch4J is used to convert 
the runnable JAR file into an executable file.
